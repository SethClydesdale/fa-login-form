# fa-login-form

This is a small HTML page add-on for Forumotoin that serves as a replacement for the default login and logout pages. It's multi-step ; you first must fill in your username before you can fill in your password. Once you've successfully logged in the account name and id will be saved to the browser for later logins. The overall design and idea was inspired by the login for Gmail.
